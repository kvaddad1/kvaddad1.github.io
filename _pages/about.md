I am a Computer Science Ph.D. student at [Johns Hopkins University](https://engineering.jhu.edu/) with a passion for exploring the intersections of Computer Science and genomics/biology. My research focuses on developing computational methods to enhance the efficacy of pangenomes in DNA-based studies and applying Data Science techniques in genomics. I earned my Master's degree in Computer Science, specializing in [Data Science & Analytics](https://dsac.iiit.ac.in/about), from [IIIT Hyderabad, India](https://www.iiit.ac.in/). After completing my Master's, I worked at [TCS Research, Life Sciences, Hyderabad, India](https://www.tcs.com/what-we-do/research), where I developed a keen interest in computational genomics and bioinformatics under the guidance of [Dr. Naveen Sivadasan](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=46wTtmUAAAAJ&hl=en) & [Dr. Rajgopal Srinivasan](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=-deXrt8AAAAJ&hl=en). Currently, I am in the [Langmead Lab](https://www.langmead-lab.org/) under the supervision of [Dr. Ben Langmead](https://engineering.jhu.edu/faculty/benjamin-langmead/), developing techniques to mitigate reference bias issues in genomic analyses.
